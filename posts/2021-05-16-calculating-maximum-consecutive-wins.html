<h2 id="intro">Intro</h2>
<p>In this post I will elaborate on the concept of calculating the maximum consecutive wins on a <strong>game-like</strong> project via <strong>SQL</strong>.</p>
<p>Let's put things in context. Assume you have a project that has a gamified aspect in its domain where you have users who win some kind of game. In this context, you may want to award players based on their performance and especially for the maximum consecutive wins. So, you need a way to have a calculation deriving from your data for this accumulation. Another assumption is that the game data are stored in some kind of database that supports <strong>SQL</strong>.</p>
