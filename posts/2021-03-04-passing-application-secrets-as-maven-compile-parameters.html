            <h1>Passing Application Secrets as Maven Compile Parameters</h1>

<h2 id="intro">Intro</h2>
<p>When you have a project that is stored on a public repo, you have to have a process to not accidentally commit and push the secrets of your application (<strong>private keys</strong>, <strong>API keys</strong>, etc) and have them visible to the public eye, unless you want to be exploited for good.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="setup">Setup</h2>
<p>One solution would be to pass such information to the application at compile/build time, utilizing code or configuration of tools you use in your project.</p>
<p>Let say we have a <strong>Maven</strong> <strong>Java</strong> project which uses an <strong>API Key</strong> for authenticating/authorizing access to a <strong>Google Service</strong>, such as <strong>Directions API</strong>. I have such a project at <a href="https://github.com/steve-papadogiannis/dist-sys-server-java">dist-sys-server-java</a> which gave me the idea of the topic of this post.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="secrets">Secrets</h2>
<p>So our application uses two properties, <code>api.key</code> and <code>test.api.key</code> to hold the values of two different keys, one for runtime and the other for testing purposes.</p>
<p>Let see how the values can be injected to the application at compile time in order to not be present in the source code.</p>
<p>The steps are shown from a top to bottom perspective.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="calling-code">Calling code</h2>
<p>In our code, at some point we want to perform an invocation to the <strong>Directions API</strong> endpoint to get the possible routes set from a start to an end point.</p>
<p>In order to perform the call we authenticate/authorize our code via the <strong>API Key</strong></p>
<p>The code to fetch the <strong>API Key</strong> could be something like the below:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/steve-papadogiannis/8efb49b6febdfff6daa99a66d5aa4839.js"></script>
<p>In the above code snippet we load the content of a <code>.properties</code> file to a <code>Properties</code> object in order to retrieve the value of a specific property named <code>api.key</code></p>
<p>A same snippet would fetch our <code>test.api.key</code> for our test suites:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/steve-papadogiannis/da6572e406ca808a8f77e6fa0dd2b76e.js"></script>
<hr />
<h2 id="properties-files">Properties files</h2>
<p>The <code>.properties</code> files are a good way to organize configurable aspects of your application and used by various frameworks and tools.</p>
<p>In our case we have two such files named <code>application.properties</code> and <code>application-test.properties</code> to hold the separate keys of runtime and testing, respectively.</p>
<p>These files are best placed at:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/steve-papadogiannis/b69d2848bda7e37dc683766a9a11a8cd.js"></script>
<p>and</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/steve-papadogiannis/3f7b4824184612e08beb856f84ae4e53.js"></script>
<p>respectively.</p>
<p>Well, now, what may these files contain?</p>
<p>The concept of these files are to have key value pairs such as:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/steve-papadogiannis/b285b6ddd979bfa48f2bb8623c6257ec.js"></script>
<p>For the project at hand, in <code>application.properties</code> we have:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/steve-papadogiannis/944bd3afbc8ad3c40470f24ec1af0f15.js"></script>
<p>What that means is that the <code>api.key</code> would take the value of another property (also named <code>api.key</code>) when resolved (thus put in <code>${...}</code>). The same also holds for the <code>application-test.properties</code>.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="pom-project-properties">Pom project properties</h2>
<p>Well, so we have keys that take the values of other keys when resolved, but where these other keys are defined?</p>
<p>The answer comes from the below lines of the <code>pom.xml</code>:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/steve-papadogiannis/5a8c81583b71883e577ba223dd9f15e0.js"></script>
<p>In the file, we define that we have two properties named <code>api.key</code> and <code>test.api.key</code> that are the ones that we resolve in the <code>.properties</code> files. The resolving is enabled by the configuration inside the <code>&lt;build&gt;</code> element of the <strong>pom</strong>, which states that the files inside the two <code>resources</code> directories should have their included <code>${...}</code> expressions resolved.</p>
<p>Thus far we are good, but what are the values of the properties in the <strong>pom</strong>?</p>
<p>Well, they are <code>${api.key}</code> and <code>${test.api.key}</code>..</p>
<p>If this is not like <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1375666/">Inception</a>, then what is?</p>
<p>Ok, so once more we have two properties that take the values of two other properties when resolved.</p>
<p>These final properties are the ones injected as <code>Java</code> system properties when we invoke the <strong>Maven compile lifecycle step</strong>:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/steve-papadogiannis/6cf9c87d833bc4b9df12828bd56e521b.js"></script>
<p>The <code>&lt;api.key.value&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;test.api.key.value&gt;</code> should be replaced with the real one in this step.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>In conclusion, we have the below sequence of steps in order to inject our secret info to our application without introducing it in the source code.</p>

<p>This process assures us that our secret info of an application is safe, and it would not be made public, when working in public repos.</p>
