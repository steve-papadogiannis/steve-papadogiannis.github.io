title: Calculate Maximum Consecutive Wins in SQL
---

## Intro

In this post I will elaborate on the concept of calculating 
the maximum consecutive wins on a **game-like** project via **SQL**.

Let\'s put things in context. Assume you have a project that has a
gamified aspect in its domain where you have users who win some kind of game.
In this context, you may want to award players based on their performance and
especially for the maximum consecutive wins. So, you need a way to 
have a calculation deriving from your data for this accumulation.
Another assumption is that the game data are stored in some kind of database
that supports **SQL**.
