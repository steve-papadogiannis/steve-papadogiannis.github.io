<h2 id="intro">Intro</h2>
<p>Recently, I decided to make an old desktop machine to a server like resource, which meant to remove any input or output peripherals except for the internet connectivity means (Ethernet cable) as to be able to access it via <code>ssh</code>.</p>
<p>Of course, a 24/7 available machine is not a very cost-effective and environment-friendly solution in a home setup, so the <strong>Wake-On-Lan</strong> feature was the right choice. This feature enables you to turn on your machine using the local network. (<em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wake-on-LAN">Wake-on-Lan</a></em>)</p>
<p>The desktop at hand runs <strong>Ubuntu 20.04.1 LTS</strong> (<strong>GNU/Linux 5.8.0-40-generic x86_64</strong>) as OS (not a server oriented one) and has an <strong>ASUS P5Q-SE</strong> parentboard with an integrated network interface controller (<strong>NIC</strong>). The network interface controller must support the <strong>Wake-On-Lan</strong> feature in order to enable it.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="install-ssh-server">Install ssh server</h2>
<p>As a zero step, I installed the <code>openssh-server</code> in order to be able to access the machine after the configuration.</p>
<p>To check if the <code>ssh</code> server is installed and/or active I issued the below command:</p>
<p><code>sudo service ssh status</code></p>
<p>If the <code>ssh</code> server is not in place, one can download it by issuing the below command:</p>
<p><code>sudo apt update &amp;&amp; sudo apt install openssh-server</code></p>
<hr />
<h2 id="use-ssh-client">Use ssh client</h2>
<p>After <code>ssh</code> server was in place and active, I performed an <code>ssh</code> connection as a health check (in order to avoid plugging/unplugging input/output devices for debugging).</p>
<p>To perform the health check I used the <a href="https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/">MobaXterm</a>.</p>
<p><code>MobaXTerm</code> is a user-friendly toolbox for remote computing, which includes a colorful <code>ssh client</code></p>
<hr />
<h2 id="enable-wol-in-bios">Enable WOL in BIOS</h2>
<p>A good guide for the steps can be found at: <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WakeOnLan#:~:text=To%20enable%20WoL%20in%20the,Save%20your%20settings%20and%20reboot.">WakeOnLan Ubuntu Help</a></p>
<p>Next step was to enter the <strong>BIOS</strong> and find the much-desired flag(s). In the aforementioned parentboard I had to enter the <strong>BIOS</strong>, go under <strong>Power</strong> section, next to <strong>APM Configuration</strong> menu and enable both <strong>Power by PCI Devices</strong> and <strong>Power by PCIE Devices</strong>. For reasons unknown to me, both flags should be enabled in order to work.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="enable-wol-in-software">Enable WOL in software</h2>
<p>After that, I had to get the name of my <strong>NIC</strong> in order to check if it supports and has enabled the <strong>WOL</strong> feature. Issuing <code>ifconfig</code> gave me the info I needed. In my case the <strong>NIC</strong> was called <code>enp2s0</code></p>
<p>Next command in line was <code>sudo ethtool enp2s0</code> which revealed its secrets:</p>
<pre><code>Supports Wake-on: pg

...

Wake-on: d</code></pre>
<p>The <code>g</code> in <code>Supports Wake-on</code> meant that I was lucky and my machine actually supported the <strong>WOL</strong> feature and the <code>d</code> in <code>Wake-on</code> meant that the feature was disabled at the time.</p>
<p>One command kept me away from fulfilling the configuration (or so I thought..).</p>
<p>I issued an <code>sudo ethtool -s enp2s0 wol g</code> to enable the feature.</p>
<p>After that I got a reassuring:</p>
<pre><code>Wake-on: g</code></pre>
<p>when I issued the <code>sudo ethtool enp2s0</code> command again.</p>
<p>Then, I shut down the machine.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="wake-on-lan-client-program">Wake-On-Lan Client program</h2>
<p>In order to perform the <strong>Wake-On-Lan</strong>s to this machine I got a portable <strong>Wake-On-Land</strong> program for my other <strong>Windows</strong> machine (which would be the client for the desktop machine).</p>
<p>The program fitted to my needs was <strong>WakeMeOnLan</strong> for <strong>Windows</strong> which can be downloaded at:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nirsoft.net/utils/wake_on_lan.html">Nirsoft WakeMeOnLan</a></p>
<p>It is a simple program to hold and awake your <strong>Wake-On-Lan</strong> machines.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="persisting-setting">Persisting setting</h2>
<p>So, I stored my machine and performed an <strong>awakening</strong>. All played well, until I shut down again the server after the session and tried to <strong>awake</strong> it again.</p>
<p>No response.</p>
<p>The cause was (maybe for security reasons, maybe not) that the <strong>enable</strong> flag was reset after shutdown. It was not <strong>persisted</strong> across boots.</p>
<p>Solution to this incident, was brought by this site: <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Wake-on-LAN">Wake-on-LAN ArchLinux Wiki</a></p>
<p>What I read and did was to make a new file at <code>/etc/systemd/system/wol@.service</code> and append the below content:</p>
<pre><code>[Unit]
Description=Wake-on-LAN for %i
Requires=network.target
After=network.target

[Service]
ExecStart=/usr/bin/ethtool -s %i wol g
Type=oneshot

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target</code></pre>
<p>What this script does is to enable the <strong>Wake-On-Lan</strong> feature in every boot after the network initializes. This is done by <code>systemd</code> automatically, so you end up with a <strong>persistent</strong> setting of the feature.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Lines above, documented a walkthrough for enabling <strong>Wake-On-Lan</strong> feature for the specific system. Many parts may vary when enabling the feature to another machine, but the concept remains as described and summarized to the next list:</p>
<ul>
<li>Install <strong>ssh-server</strong></li>
<li>Use an <strong>ssh client</strong></li>
<li>Enable <strong>WOL</strong> in <strong>BIOS</strong></li>
<li>Enable <strong>WOL</strong> in software</li>
<li><strong>Wake-On-Lan Client</strong> program</li>
<li>(<em>Optional</em>) Persisting setting</li>
</ul>
