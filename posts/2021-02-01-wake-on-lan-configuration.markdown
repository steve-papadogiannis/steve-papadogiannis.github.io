title: Enabling Wake On Lan Feature on Ubuntu
---

Recently, I decided to make an old desktop machine to a server like resource, 
which meant to remove any input or output peripherals except for the 
internet connectivity means (Ethernet cable) as to be able to access it via `ssh`.

Of course, a 24/7 available machine is not a very cost-effective and 
environment-friendly solution in a home setup, so the **Wake-On-Lan** feature 
was the right choice.
